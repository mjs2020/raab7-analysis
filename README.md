## Survey analysis pipeline

Once populated, these pages will contain a suite of scripts for analysing raw RAAB data and exporting key datapoints to a report. Because of minor differences between versions, separate scripts have been written to analyse data from the fifth (RAAB5), sixth (RAAB6) and seventh (RAAB7) versions of the RAAB protocol.
