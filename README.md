## Survey analysis pipeline

To accommodate differences between RAAB versions, separate scripts have been written to analyse data from the fifth (RAAB5), sixth (RAAB6) and seventh (RAAB7) version of the RAAB protocol. 

These pages contain a suite of scripts for analysing raw RAAB data and exporting key summary data to a report.
